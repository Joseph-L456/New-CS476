This is a school project.

It was supposed to be a 3-person team project. However, my teammates withdrew from the course a week before the due date. As a result, it is the first draft I made in 3 days.

An unknown bug happened after I came back to China. The .css files of the main page can only be occasionally loaded by the website, making this project even more ridiculous.

You have my apology.
